# Event Time generation script

This script is responsible for generating the json objects for upcoming events.

After use it should spit out a json file into the static folder that overwrites the existing one. Make sure you dont have any changes you want to keep in that file!

> [!WARNING]  
> AGAIN! This will by default overwrite the file in `/static/json/events.json`!\
> Make sure you do not have any changes to that file you wish to keep!

Make sure to update the current year and the start date/times.
