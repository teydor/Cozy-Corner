About The Cozy Corner
{{< /heading >}}

{{< justify-text >}}
The Cozy Corner is a student lead support group for queer and queer questioning people.\
It's a place for conversations about queer related issues, a place to be listened to and supported by like minded peers.

The Cozy Corner is an international students initiative. Everone who attends is equally responsible for the conversations, topics and making sure everyone feels equally respected and heard.

We meet up bi-weekly in a space graciously provided by the fulda community center.
We all work together to keep the space clean and well kept fo us and anyone else in the lcoal community. 

If you want to be a part of a local english-speaking queer community, make connections and feel listened to - __You're always welcomed in the Cozy Corner!__
