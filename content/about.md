About The Cozy Corner
{{< /heading >}}

{{< center-text >}}
The Cozy Corner is a student lead support group initiative for queer and queer questioning induvidiuals.\
The group is the space where we give each other space to talk about queer stuff that we can’t or not comfortable talking about anywhere else.

Cozy Corner is an international students initiative, where every participant is an equal part of the group responsible for its implementation.

__If you want to be a part of a local english-speaking queer community, make connections and to feel listened to - Cozy Corner welcomes you!__
