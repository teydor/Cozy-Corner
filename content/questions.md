{{< accordion-item title="Who can come to the group?" heading="headingTwo" target="collapseTwo" parent="questionsAccordion" >}}

**Everyone queer and queer-questioning.** Obviously, we’re not going to _“check”_ your queerness.

Just remember that this is a safe space dedicated to queer people first and foremost, where they can rest from the cis-hetero-normative world, amongst people that can relate to their struggles.

{{< accordion-item title="Can germans and non-students come too?" heading="headingThree" target="collapseThree" parent="questionsAccordion" >}}

**Yes!**

As long as you speak English during the group and in need support of fellow queer people – you are welcome here! :)

{{< accordion-item title="Is there a groupchat that I can join?" heading="headingFour" target="collapseFour" parent="questionsAccordion" >}}

**Yes.** This one. 

**Important:** people are added only after they have attended a meeting at least once.

{{< accordion-item title="Do I need to be strictly on time? " heading="headingFive" target="collapseFive" parent="questionsAccordion" >}}

**Preferably, yes.** 

You can be late, but please take note that we are meeting at `7:00 pm` and after the introductions the discussion itself starts at `7:20.`

If you are new, arrive at `7:00 pm.` If you’re not new, you can arrive no later than `7:20.`

 _Overall, please don’t be late so you don’t disturb the group._
