These are the group rules, there arent that many, so make sure to read them!

**1.** The group is attended only by queer and queer-questioning individuals. 

**2.** Group is a place where we give each other space to talk about what we can’t talk about anywhere else.\
So everything that is being said in the group should stay within the group.

**3.** We raise a hand if we want to say something, and talk only in turns.

**4.** We stick to the chosen topic and avoid dialogues during its discussion.

**5.** We don’t give advice unless it's being asked for.

**6.** All participants are equal regardless of their gender, age, labels, stage of transition, etc.

**7.** We do not question anyone about their labels and we do not ask to educate us on them.\
 Everyone shares as much information about themselves as they want to.

**8.** We speak in _“I” statements_, talk about only ourselves and share only our personal experiences.

**9.** We use the _“STOP”_ word, if something offensive or rule-breaking was said, even if not every group participant sees it.

**10.** Any psychoactive substances such as weed and alcohol during the group are prohibited. \
Being present on the group in an inebriated state is not allowed.

**11.** We move freely during the group, for example in the bathroom, for tea and etc. but try to not make noise or crackle with wrappers.

**12.** For the duration of topic discussions we put our phones on mute and do not use them.

**13.** We are thankful to the place that we are meeting up in and the group we are a part of,so everyone makes sure that every participant\
 feels comfortable in this space, and we clean all of the trash we have left after ourselves.
